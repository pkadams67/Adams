				<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>My privacy policy applies to information I collect when you use or access my website, applications, or interact with me. I may change this privacy policy from time to time. Whenever I make changes to this privacy policy, the changes become active ten days after I post the revised privacy policy (as indicated by changing the date on my privacy policy). I encourage you to review my privacy policy whenever you access my services to stay informed about my information practices and how you can help protect your privacy.</p>
				<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
					<p><strong>Information You Provide to Me</strong>&mdash;I collect the information you provide directly to me. For example, I collect information when you participate in any interactive features of my services, fill out a form, request customer support, provide any contact or identifying information, or otherwise communicate with me. The types of information I may collect include your name, email address, postal address, credit card information, and other contact or identifying information you choose to provide.</p>
					<p><strong>Information I Automatically Collect When You Use the Services</strong>&mdash;When you access or use my services, I automatically gather information about you, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Log Information:</em> I record information about your use of my services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to my services.</li>
						<li><em>Device Information:</em> I collect information about the computer you use to access my services, including the hardware model, operating system, and version.</li>
						<li><em>Location Information:</em> I may gather information about the location of your device each time you access or use one of my mobile applications or otherwise consent to the collection of this information.</li>
						<li><em>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</em> I use various technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your device memory that help me to improve my services and your experience, see which areas and features of my services are popular, and count visits. I may also collect information using web beacons (also known as &ldquo;tracking pixels&rdquo;). Web beacons are electronic images that I may use in my services or emails and track count visits or understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more details about how I collect information, including details about cookies and how to disable them, please see &ldquo;Your Information Choices&rdquo; below.</li>
					</ul>
						<p><strong>Information I Collect from Other Sources</strong>&mdash;To provide you with access to the Service, or to provide you with better service in general, I may combine information obtained from other sources (for example, a third-party service whose application you have authorized or used to sign in) and combine that with the information I collect through my services.</p>
				<h2>Use of Information</h2>
					<p>I may use information about you for various purposes, including to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Provide, maintain, and improve my services;</li>
							<li>Provide services you request, process transactions, and send you related information;</li>
							<li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;</li>
							<li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests to provide customer service;</li>
							<li>Communicate with you about news and information related to my service;</li>
							<li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities about my services; and </li>
							<li>Personalize and improve my services.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>By accessing and using my services, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to the United States and other countries.</p>
					<p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong>&mdash;I may share personal information about you as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>With third party vendors and other service providers who need access to your information to carry out work on my behalf;</li>
							<li>If I believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;</li>
							<li>To enforce applicable user agreements or policies, including my <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>; and to protect me, my users, or the public from harm or illegal activities;
							</li>
							<li>In connection with any merger or acquisition of all or a portion of my business to another company; and</li>
							<li>If I notify you through my services (or in my Privacy Policy) that I will share the information you provide in a manner, and you provide such information.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>I may also share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.</p>
					<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics</strong>&mdash;I may allow third parties to provide analytics services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your use of the services and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by third parties and me to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and other websites, and better understand your online activity. My privacy policy does not apply to, and I am not responsible for third-party cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies. I encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.</p>
					<p><strong>Security</strong>&mdash;I take reasonable measures to help protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
				<h2>Your Information Choices</h2>
					<p><strong>Location Information</strong>&mdash;When you first launch any of my mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application&rsquo;s collection of this information. If you initially agree to my collection of location information, you can subsequently stop collecting this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, my mobile applications, or certain features thereof, will no longer function. You may also stop collecting location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove all my mobile applications from your device.</p>
					<p><strong>Cookies</strong>&mdash;Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you decide to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of my services.</p>
					<p><strong>Promotional Communications</strong>&mdash;You may opt out of receiving any promotional emails from me by following the instructions in those emails. If you were to opt out, I might still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or my ongoing business relations.</p>
				<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
					<p>California law permits California residents to request specific details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please <a href="mailto:paul@adams.io?subject=California Privacy Rights">contact me</a>. However, note that under the law, services such as mine that permit California residents to opt in to, or opt-out of, this type of sharing are not required to provide such information upon receiving a request, but rather may respond by notifying the user of his or her right to prevent the disclosure. You may <a href="mailto:paul@adams.io?subject=California Privacy Rights">contact me</a> to opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes.</p>
