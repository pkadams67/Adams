            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>These terms of use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) apply to your access and use of any of my software applications (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). Please read them carefully.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Accepting These Terms</strong>&mdash;If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all the terms. If you do not agree to all the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a word does not make sense to you, please let me know.

            <p>
              <strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>&mdash;I reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, I may need to change these Terms if I come out with a new feature or for some other reason. Whenever I make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective ten days after I post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance, if I provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the Service for changes to these Terms. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, you have accepted these Terms' changes.
