        <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>These terms of use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) apply to your access and use of any of my software applications (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). Please read them carefully.</p>
          <p><strong>Accepting These Terms</strong>&mdash;If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all the terms. If you do not agree to all the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also, if a word does not make sense to you, please let me know.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes to These Terms</strong>&mdash;I reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, I may need to change these Terms if I come out with a new feature or for some other reason. Whenever I make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective ten days after I post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance, if I provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the Service for changes to these Terms. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, you have accepted these Terms&rsquo; changes.</p>
          <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>&mdash;For information about how I collect and use information about users of the Service, please review my <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

Your use of the Service may also include the use of developed or owned applications by a third party. Your use of such third-party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party&rsquo;s terms of service or privacy policies. I encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party application, website, or service that you visit or use.</p>
          <p><strong>Creating Accounts</strong>&mdash;When you create an account or use another service to log in to the Service, you agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to any data or other information you provide to the Service. If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let me know as soon as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Your Content and Conduct</strong>&mdash;My Service allows you and other users to post, link, and otherwise make available content.

            <li>Mass or repeated promotions, political campaigning, or commercial messages directed at users who do not follow you (SPAM);</li>

          <ul>

          <h2>Your Information Choices</h2>
            <p><strong>Location Information</strong>&mdash;When you first launch any of my software applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application&rsquo;s collection of this information. If you initially agree to my collection of location information, you can subsequently stop collecting this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, my mobile applications, or certain features thereof, will no longer function. You may also stop collecting location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove any of my mobile applications from your device.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong>&mdash;Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you decide to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of my services.</p>
            <p><strong>Promotional Communications</strong>&mdash;You may opt out of receiving any promotional emails from me by following the instructions in those emails. If you were to opt out, I might still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or my ongoing business relations.</p>
            <p><strong>Materials</strong>&mdash;I put much effort into creating the Service including, the logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, and other content (excluding your content). I or my licensors own this property, and U.S. and international copyright laws protect it. I grant you the right to use it. However, unless I expressly say otherwise, your rights do not include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Publicly performing or publicly displaying the Service;</li>
              <li>Changing or otherwise making any derivative uses of the Service or any part thereof;</li>
              <li>Using any data mining, robots, or similar data gathering or extraction methods;</li>
              <li>Downloading (other than page caching) of any part of the Service or any information held there;</li>

            <p><strong>Hyperlinks and Third-Party Content</strong>&mdash;You may create a hyperlink to the Service. However, you may not use, frame, or use framing techniques to enclose any of my trademarks, logos, or other proprietary information without my express written consent. I make no claim or representation regarding and accept no responsibility for third-party websites accessible by hyperlink from the Service or websites linking to the Service. When you leave the Service, you should be aware that these Terms and policies no longer govern. If there is any content on the Service from you and others, I do not review, verify, or authenticate it, and it may include inaccuracies or false information. I make no representations, warranties, or guarantees relating to the quality, suitability, truth, accuracy, or completeness of any content contained in the Service. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of or reliance on any content.</p>
          <h2>Unavoidable Legal Matter</h2>
            <p>The service and any other service and content included on or otherwise made available to you through the service are provided to you on an as-is or as available basis without any representations or warranties of any kind. I disclaim all warranties and representations (express or implied, oral or written) concerning the service and content included on or otherwise made available to you through the service whether alleged to arise by operation of law, because of custom or usage in the trade, by course of dealing or otherwise. In no event will I be liable to you or any third party for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the service or any other service and/or content included on or otherwise made available to you through the Service, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, even if I have been advised of the possibility of such damages or are aware of the possibility of such damages. My total liability for all causes of action and under all theories of responsibility will be limited to the amount you paid to me. This section would be given full effect even if any remedy specified in this agreement is deemed to have failed of its essential purpose. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold me harmless from and against all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) I incur about, arising from, or to avoid, any claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Service or the use of the Service by any person using your account, including any claim that your use of the Service violates any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party, and/or your violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p><strong>Copyright Complaints</strong>&mdash;I take intellectual property rights seriously. According to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) and other applicable law, I have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and, at my sole discretion, access to the service for users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.</p>

You further acknowledge and expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction in the United States courts about any such dispute, including any claim involving Service. You further agree that you and Service will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.</p>
            <p><strong>Termination</strong>&mdash;If you breach any of these Terms, I have the right to suspend or disable your access to or use of the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>&mdash;These Terms form the entire agreement between you and me regarding the use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and me relating to your use of the Service.</p>
