I disclaim all warranties and representations (express or implied, oral or written) concerning the Service and content included on or otherwise made available to you through the Service whether alleged to arise by operation of law, because of custom or usage in the trade, by course of dealing or otherwise. In no event will I be liable to you or any third party for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the Service or any other service and content included on or otherwise made available to you through the Service, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, even if I have been advised of the possibility of such damages or are aware of the possibility of such damages. My total liability for all causes of action and under all theories of responsibility will be limited to the amount you paid to me. This section would be given full effect even if any remedy specified in this agreement has failed its essential purpose. You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold me harmless from and against any costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, penalties, interest, and disbursements) I incur concerning, arising from, or to avoid, any claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Service or the use of the Service by any person using your account, including any claim that your use of the Service violates any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party, or your violation of these Terms.</p>
